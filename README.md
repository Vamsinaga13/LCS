LOCAL COMMUNITY SYSTEM [COMMUNITY CONNECT]
# CommunityConnect

## **Project Overview**
CommunityConnect is a web-based platform designed exclusively for colleges to bridge the gap between academic and extracurricular activities. Many students miss classes due to extracurricular participation without proper tracking. This platform ensures students can seamlessly engage in events while staying informed about their academic commitments.

## **Why This Project?**
- In colleges, students often claim to have attended extracurricular activities when they actually missed classes.
- Many college events fail to reach all students, leading to low participation.
- There is no structured system to track both attendance and extracurricular involvement.
- Inspired by platforms like **Microsoft Teams**, this project ensures better organization and communication for students.

## **How It Helps in the Real World?**
- **Transparent Attendance Tracking:** Ensures students cannot misuse extracurricular activities as an excuse for missing classes.
- **Event Awareness:** All students get notified about upcoming events, increasing participation.
- **Centralized Platform:** Acts as a unified system to manage academic schedules and extracurricular activities.
- **Encourages Engagement:** Students can host and participate in events effortlessly.
